`611Study.ICU` refers to the "Study from 6 AM to 11 PM, and end up in ICU" lifestyle, which is the forced schedule in many junior and senior high schools in China. As a result, countless students suffer both physically and mentally from this schedule.
Through this project, we aim to help Chinese students escape this prison-like timetable and have a healthy and happy childhood.

This project is inspired by [996.ICU](https://996.icu/#/zh_CN), the cry from a programmer about the 996 work schedule.
